/**
 * The original version of GeoHash failed to properly encapsulate the representation

 * Please use your original GeoHash work to complete this class.
 *
 * After you complete this class, go and complete the GeoDBFactory, GeoHashFactory,
 * and DefaultGeoDBConfiguration.
 *
 * You will need to update your implementation of GeoDB to use a GeoHashFactory to
 * produce geohash objects when the insert, delete, nearby, contains, etc. methods
 * are called. You cannot directly call your old GeoHash class or assume that your
 * implementation of the GeoHash will be provided to your GeoDB.
 *
 * There are some items marked with @Bonus that are not required. However, if you
 * want an additional challenge, knock these items out AFTER completing everything
 * else.
